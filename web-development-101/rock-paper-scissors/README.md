# Rock paper scissors project for The Odin Project

Thought it was going to be an easy one, but it actually took all day and the result is kinda underwhelming, probably due to design, which is kinda ugly. But it is at least responsive. I had to wrap some elements in `div`s to align them properly, but it could've been done more cleanly. On the script part, the `selectButton()` function is massive and should've been separated into smaller logical parts. The rest of the script could be improved also.
